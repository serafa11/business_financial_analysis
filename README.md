# Business Financial Analysis

This repository contains various financial analysis projects, including:

- **Budgeting automation** – Streamlining the calculation of financial budgeting metrics
- **Sales forecasting with linear regression** – Simple forecasting models to predict future sales
- **Supervised machine learning for sales prediction** – Enhanced forecasting using more advanced regression techniques

**Note:** You can open these Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab, but you won't be able to run the code without the datasets.

You can find the required datasets [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E6RpPsGbSLiJh7s6IKAPpSKczFRp2Ksp?usp=drive_link).  
In the `Sales_forecast` notebook, the dataset originally named `train` has been renamed to `sales`. Please double-check the file names when loading the data to ensure everything runs correctly.
